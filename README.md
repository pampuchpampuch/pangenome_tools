# Pangenome models exploratory project
Bioinformatic and data science project (recently started) with a goal of finding out how different pangenome models correspond to each other:
1. What are the similarities and differences
2. Do they complement each other or contradict?
3. Is joinded analysis possible and what insight could it bring?

This project includes models manipulation and developement of metrics that allow for models comparison. Exploratory analysis of data represented in those models could bring valuable insight allowing for models' improvement and developement of new construction methods as well as pangenome data visualization.

For now, models that are considered in the analysis are:
- variation graphs
- whole genome alignement
- model generated by [Panaroo pipeline](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo)
